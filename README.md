# Neal Haldar
This is the story of my life. 
I am a Chemistry major (B.S.) in the College of Chemistry at UC Berkeley. 

This is a video I made in high school for the Breakthrough challenge. I endeavoured to explain the concept of enantiomers to a broader audience without sacrificing clarity or scientific accuracy.

I love learning for fun, whether it be exploring mathematical quirks with infinite series or self-studying organic chemistry. You will probably find me curled up in a corner with my latest paper or playing some game or the other to try and keep myself entertained.
